# EBNF Structure of the Septuagint Apparatus

This document presents the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar that defines the structure of the Septuagint apparatus. 
The parser processes textual variants and readings from the Septuagint Bible and converts them into a structured format. 
This EBNF aims to capture the syntactic rules as implemented in the parser code, with a particular focus on the **witness identifiers (`<witness_id>`)** and how they are processed within the apparatus.

## Detailed Description (Updated)

### Apparatus Structure

#### `<apparatus>`

- Represents the entire apparatus, which consists of multiple entry lines.
- **Definition**: A sequence of `<entry_line>` elements.

#### `<entry_line>`

- Corresponds to a single line in the apparatus file.
- **Definition**: Optionally starts with `<chapter_verse>`, followed by `<entry_content>`.

#### `<chapter_verse>`

- Specifies the chapter and verse numbers.
- **Definition**: Optionally includes a chapter `<number>` followed by a colon and a verse `<number>`, or just a verse `<number>`.
- **Examples**:
  - `"3:16"` (Chapter 3, Verse 16)
  - `"16"` (Verse 16, chapter inferred from context)

### Entry Content

#### `<entry_content>`

- Contains one or more `<variant>` elements, separated by `" | "`.
- **Definition**: A `<variant>` followed by zero or more sequences of `" | "` and another `<variant>`.

#### `<variant>`

- Represents a textual variant in the apparatus.

#### `<witness_id>` (Detailed)

The witness identifiers can have various forms, reflecting the diversity in manuscript notation. The parser code handles several special cases, which are captured in the updated EBNF.

- **Definition**:
  - **Special Identifiers**:
    - `"ùîê"`: Represents the Majority Text.
    - `"Lat"` `<alphanum_sequence>`: Latin manuscripts or versions, where `"Lat"` is followed by an alphanumeric sequence.
  - **Numeric Identifiers**:
    - `<digit_sequence>`: One or more digits, possibly followed by non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., `"120*"`, `"120a"`).
  - **Alphabetic Identifiers**:
    - `<letter_sequence>`: One or more letters, possibly followed by digits and non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., `"A"`, `"B2"`).
  - **Alphanumeric Identifiers**:
    - `<alphanum_sequence>`: A combination of letters and digits (e.g., `"P45"`, `"f1"`).
  - **Non-Alphanumeric Suffixes**:
    - `<non_alphanum_sequence>`: Characters such as asterisks, hyphens, or other symbols (e.g., `"A*"`, `"120*"`, `"B'"`).

- **Components**:
  - `<digit_sequence>`: One or more digits `[0-9]+`.
  - `<letter_sequence>`: One or more letters `[A-Za-z]+`, including Greek letters.
  - `<alphanum_sequence>`: A mix of letters and digits.
  - `<non_alphanum_sequence>`: Characters that are neither letters nor digits, such as `'*'`, `'‚Äì'`, or punctuation.

- **Examples**:
  - `"ùîê"`: Special identifier for the Majority Text.
  - `"LatV"`: Latin version `V`.
  - `"120"`: Manuscript numbered `120`.
  - `"A"`: Manuscript labeled `A`.
  - `"P45"`: Papyrus `45`.
  - `"f1"`: Family `1`.
  - `"120*"`: Manuscript `120` with an asterisk, indicating a particular notation.
  - `"B'"`: Manuscript `B` with a prime symbol.

**Special Cases Handled in the Parser Code**:

- **Single Greek Character Witnesses**: Witnesses like `"ùîê"` are recognized directly.
- **Witnesses Starting with Digits**:
  - Segments starting with digits are treated as numeric witness IDs.
  - Non-digit suffixes may be considered notes or part of the witness ID.
- **Witnesses with Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**:
  - Two-letter identifiers where the first is uppercase and the second is lowercase (e.g., `"Pc"`) may represent a witness with a note.
- **Witnesses Starting with `"Lat"`**:
  - `"Lat"` followed by letters or numbers denotes Latin manuscripts or versions.
- **Witnesses with Hyphens or Special Characters**:
  - Witness IDs may contain hyphens or other non-alphanumeric characters, which are handled appropriately.
- **Combined Segments**:
  - In cases where a witness ID spans multiple segments (e.g., `"Lib geneal"`), the parser attempts to combine them.

### Notes

#### `<note>`

- Provides additional information about a witness or reading.
- **Definition**: Text enclosed in parentheses.

- **Examples**:
  - `"(lac)"`: Indicates a lacuna (gap) in the manuscript.
  - `"(vid)"`: Indicates that the reading is uncertain.

### Lexical Elements

#### `<number>`

- A sequence of digits.
- **Definition**: One or more digits `[0-9]+`.

#### `<greek_text>`

- A sequence of Greek characters and specific punctuation.
- **Definition**: Zero or more `<greek_char>` or allowed punctuation.

- **Allowed Characters**:
  - Greek Unicode characters.
  - Punctuation: `"."`, `" º"`, `"ÃÖ"`, `"-"`, and space.

#### `<greek_char>`

- Any Unicode character in the Greek script ranges.
- **Unicode Ranges**:
  - `\u0370` to `\u03FF`
  - `\u1F00` to `\u1FFF`

#### `<any_char_except_closing_paren>`

- Any character except the closing parenthesis `")"`.

#### `<alphanum_sequence>`

- A sequence of letters and digits.
- **Definition**: A letter or digit followed by zero or more letters or digits.

#### `<letter_sequence>`

- A sequence of letters.
- **Definition**: One or more letters.

#### `<digit_sequence>`

- A sequence of digits.
- **Definition**: One or more digits.

#### `<non_alphanum_sequence>`

- A sequence of non-alphanumeric characters.
- **Definition**: Zero or more characters that are neither letters nor digits.

#### `<letter>`

- An alphabetic character.
- **Definition**: Uppercase or lowercase letters `[A-Za-z]`, including Greek letters.

#### `<digit>`

- A numeric digit.

## Special Considerations

### Witness Identifier Parsing

- **Complexity**: Witness identifiers can be complex, involving combinations of letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Parser Logic**:
  - **Special Cases**: The parser recognizes specific identifiers like `"ùîê"` and prefixes like `"Lat"`.
  - **Digits and Letters**: Witness IDs may start with digits (e.g., `"120"`) or letters (e.g., `"A"`, `"B2"`).
  - **Non-Alphanumeric Suffixes**: Characters like `'*'` or `'‚Äì'` may be attached to witness IDs.
  - **Combined Segments**: The parser attempts to combine adjacent segments if they likely form a single witness ID (e.g., `"Lib geneal"`).
- **Handling Notes**:
  - Non-alphanumeric suffixes or additional characters may be treated as notes associated with the witness.
  - Parenthetical notes are explicitly parsed and attached to the witness.

### Range Element in Location

- **Importance**: The range element allows specifying a span of text rather than a single point.
- **Syntax**: `<loc> [ <range_indicator> <loc> ]`
  - If the range indicator is present, it signifies that the variant affects all text between the two `<loc>` positions.
- **Processing in Parser**:
  - The parser searches for range indicators (`"‚Äî"`, `"‚Ä¶"`, `"-"`) to identify ranges.
  - Start and end locations are extracted and structured using the Web Annotation Ontology (`oa:RangeSelector`).
  - If no range is detected, the location is treated as a single point.

### Witness Processing

- Witnesses can have notes and may require complex parsing to extract information accurately.
- The parser handles special cases where witness IDs might be combined with notes or other qualifiers.
- Witness information is essential for textual criticism and understanding the attestation of variants.
